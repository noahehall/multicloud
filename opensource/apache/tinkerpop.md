## Gremlin

- a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph. Every Gremlin traversal is composed of a sequence of (potentially nested) steps.

## Property Graph

### Data Model

- vertices: entity nodes
- edges: relationships connecting nodes
- properties: represent and store data
- labels: attached to vertices and edges
