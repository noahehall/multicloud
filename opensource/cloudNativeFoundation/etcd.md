# ETCD

- a distributed, reliable key-value store for distributed systems
- a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines.
- It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node
