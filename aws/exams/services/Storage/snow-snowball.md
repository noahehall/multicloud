## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- migrate terabytes of data to the cloud without limits in storage capacity or compute power.
  - Move databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data and media content to the cloud
- run compute workloads with little or no connectivity.
- ruggedized chassis, integrated logistics, and tamper-evident box
- use cases
  - Data collection
  - Machine learning and processing
  - Storage in environments with intermittent connectivity or in remote disconnected locations

### pricing

- pay for use of the device and for data transfer out of AWS.
  - ondemand
  - commited (upfront):

## basics

### Storage Optimized

- highest storage capacity

### Compute Optimized

- more available vCPUs with a lower storage capacity.
