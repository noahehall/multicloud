## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- Deliver low-latency data access to on-premises applications while leveraging AWS
- Provide on-premises applications access to cloud-backed storage
- unlimited cloud storage to users and applications without deploying new storage hardware.
- compliance efforts with key capabilities like encryption, audit logging, and write-once, read-many (WORM) storage.

### pricing

- type and amount of storage you use
- the requests you make
- the amount of data transferred out of AWS.

## basics

- for all other gateway services, check one of colocated files

### Hardware Appliance

- a physical, standalone, validated server configuration for on-premises deployments
- pre-loaded with Storage Gateway software, and provides all the required CPU, memory, network, and SSD cache resources for creating and configuring File Gateway, Volume Gateway, or Tape Gateway.
- out of the box experience that does not require any additional infrastructure, and is managed from the AWS Console or API.
- use cases: branch offices, research and development departmental workgroups, and laboratory or industrial sites
