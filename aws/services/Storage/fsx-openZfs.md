- SSD Storage: average amount of storage provisioned per month, measured in gigabyte-months "GB-months,"
- SSD IOPS: three IOPS are included for every GB of SSD storage.
  - optionally provision a higher level of IOPS: pay for average IOPS provisioned above your included rate for the month, measured in "IOPS-months".
