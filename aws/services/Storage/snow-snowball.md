# Snowball

- edge computing, data migration, and edge storage device
- moving offline data or remote storage to the cloud

## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- migrate terabytes of data to the cloud without limits in storage capacity or compute power.
  - Move databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data and media content to the cloud
- run compute workloads with little or no connectivity.
- ruggedized chassis, integrated logistics, and tamper-evident box
- work with or without the internet, do not require a dedicated IT operator, and are designed to be used in remote environments
- use cases
  - Data collection
  - Machine learning and processing
  - Storage in environments with intermittent connectivity or in remote disconnected locations

### pricing

- pay for use of the device and for data transfer out of AWS.
  - ondemand
  - commited (upfront):

## basics

### Storage Optimized

- highest storage capacity
  - 24 vCPUs of compute capacity
  - 80 terabytes (TB) of usable block or S3-compatible object storage.
- use cases
  - local storage
  - large-scale data transfers.
  - data transfer-only jobs, without compute capacity enabled, at a reduced cost.

### Compute Optimized

- more available vCPUs with a lower storage capacity.
  - 52 vCPUs
  - 42 TB of usable block or s3-compatible object storage
  - optional GPU for high performance computing
