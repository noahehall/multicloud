## Skill Assessment

### personal development

- takes place over the course of a person's entire life
- involves formal and informal activities for developing others in roles such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, life coach or mentor.
- activities that
  - improve awareness and identity,
  - develop talents and potential,
  - build human capital and facilitate employability,
  - enhance the quality of life
  - contribute to the realization of dreams and aspirations.
  - Improving self-awareness
  - Improving self-knowledge
  - Improving skills and/or learning new ones
  - Building or renewing identity/self-esteem
  - Developing strengths or talents
  - Improving a career
  - Identifying or improving potential
  - Building employability or (alternatively) human capital
  - Enhancing lifestyle and/or the quality of life and time-management
  - Improving health
  - improving wealth or social status
  - Fulfilling aspirations
  - Initiating a life enterprise
  - Defining and executing personal development plans (PDPs)
  - Improving social relations or emotional intelligence
  - spiritual identity development and recognition
- When personal development takes place in the context of institutions,
- it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual level in organizations.
- As a field of research,
  - personal-development topics appear in psychology journals, education research, management journals and books, and human-development economics.
  - draws on links to other academic disciplines
    - education for questions of learning and assessment
    - psychology for motivation and personality
    - sociology for identity and social networks
    - economics for human capital and economic value
    - philosophy for ethics and self-reflection
- as an industry
  - business to consumer
    - involves selling books, courses and techniques to individuals
  - business to business
    - generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources, recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market,[6] not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting, training and coaching.
  - consumer to business
    - a business model in which consumers (individuals) create value and businesses consume that value
    - when a consumer writes reviews or when a consumer gives a useful idea for new product development then that consumer is creating value for the business if the business adopts the input.
  - consumer to consumer
    - markets provide an innovative way to allow customers to interact with each other.
    - the business facilitates an environment where customers can sell goods or services to each other
    - Consumer to consumer (or citizen-to-citizen) electronic commerce involves the electronically facilitated transactions between consumers through some third party
- Any sort of development — whether economic, political, biological, organisational or personal—requires a framework if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred.
  - Goals or benchmarks that define the end-points
  - Strategies or plans for reaching goals
  - Measurement and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path
  - A feedback system to provide information on changes
- Research on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by Albert Bandura (born 1925), suggested that self-efficacy[19] best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results
  - According to Bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because:[20]
    - it makes you expect to succeed
    - it allows you take risks and set challenging goals
    - it helps you keep trying if at first you don't succeed
    - it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough
- Martin Seligman proposed a new focus: on healthy individuals[citation needed] rather than on pathology (he created the "positive psychology" current)
  - a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness
    - courage, optimism, interpersonal skill, work ethic, hope, honesty and perseverance
- Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal development[23] for young adults during their undergraduate years:
  - developing competence
  - managing emotions
  - achieving autonomy and interdependence
  - developing mature interpersonal relationships
  - establishing identity
  - developing purpose
  - developing integrity
- Steve Salerno
  - uses the acronym SHAM: The Self-Help and Actualization Movement—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful
  - Others similarly point out that with self-help books 'supply increases the demand...The more people read them, the more they think they need them...more like an addiction than an alliance

### personal development planning

- the process of creating an action plan based on awareness, values, reflection ,goal-setting and planning for personal devleopment within the context of a career, education, relationship or for self-improvement
- types
  - PDP personal development plan
  - IDP individual development plan
  - PEP personal enterprise plan
- curriculum
  - includes a statement of one's aspirations, strengths or competencies, education and training, and stages or steps to indicate how the plan is to be realized.
  - include a portfolio containing evidence of the skills gathered over a particular timeframe.
  - undertaking PDPs will assist in creating self-directed independent learners who are more likely to progress to higher levels of academic attainment.
  - may also include a statement of one's career and lifestyle priorities, career positioning, analysis of opportunities and risks, and alternative plans (Plan B), and a curriculum vitae (CV).

#### action plan

- detailed plan outlining actions needed to reach one/more goals
- sequence of steps that must be taken, or activities that must be performed well, for a strategy to succeed
- goal
- primary objective of an action plan
- the possibility of your dreams and prospects being brought to life
- creates motivatino and provides you with a certainty that the infal outcome will be worthwhile
- achieved by being fully dedicated to the process and using the structured guide to accomplishing it
  - process
    - When creating action plans there are guided steps that need to be followed to ensure success, however the structure can be altered in the process.
    - will need to outline what you want to achieve from the project, by doing this you set yourself targets.
    - specific roles will need to be allocated ensuring sufficient amount of training, resources and issues have been considered to ensure solving any problems that may occur
    - members of the group to analyse the progress by outlining milestones, solving any issues and making any necessary changes
  - attributes [Mike Desjardins]
    - Ownership:
    - Metrics
    - budget
    - milestone date

#### career assessments

- designed to discover the skills, aptitude and talents of candidates.
- are tools that are designed to help individuals understand how a variety of personal attributes (i.e., data values, preferences, motivations, aptitudes and skills), impact their potential success and satisfaction with different career options and work environments. [wiki]
- types
  - methodology
    - quanititative
      - precisely measure key attributes belived to influence an individuals potential success and satisfaction with a career
    - **qualitative**
      - exercises designed to help individuals clarify their goals and preferences
  - measured attributes
    - some focus on an individuals interaacts, aptitude
    - others on skills/values
    - KDIs
      - key development indicators
      - define measurements for specific types of careers and **match individual career aspirations with needs of companies**
  - validity
    - the degree to which interpretation of the results of the assessment/decisions made from the results are useful
    - should be verified empiracally
  - target customer profile
    - some are designed to serve broad markets
      - i.e. **virtually any individual choosing a perogram,career clusters, starting their career, considering a career change**

#### self-assessment

- useful in assessing the areas in which a candidate has strengths and limitations
- useful in helping candidates to choose a career that is in tune with their goals and talents.
- these types of assessments have been proven to introduce more career options, increase satisfaction in one’s career plan and increase the understanding of oneself (Prince et al., 2003).
- Data as to how often people change careers are unavailable while there's a considerable mythology about it, no systematic studies have been undertaken
- The biggest benefit of career assessment, therefore, is that it enables candidates to make the best career decisions to grow both personally and professionally.
- types
  - career interest tests
    - strong interest inventory
    - campbell interest and skill inventory
  - self assessment
    - what color is your parachute (book)
- people unhappy with work-life balance
  - reasons why
  - Psychoanalytically-Informed Career Assessment
    - also referred to as psychodynamic career assessment) developed in 2000 by Dr. Lynn Friedman,
      - explores whether the conflicts seen in their careers or career counseling sessions are repeated elsewhere in their lives, for example in school, or with their parents.
      - aims to understand the unconscious factors that create conflicts and identify ways to resolve these conflicts.[7]
- Assessment of a skill should comply with the four principles of validity, reliability, fairness and flexibility. [wiki]
  - validity
    - primary requirement, if this is not met, others are irrelevant
    - an assessment process effectively assesses what it is claimed and intended to assess
  - reliability
    - a realiable assessment is one where the evidence elicited and interpration of evidence is consistent with the skill required
      - so that the assessment consistently produces outcomes that are compliant with the standard
  - fairness
    - the assessment process must be clearly understood by the candidates
  - flexibility
    - flexibility of assessment is desiralbe where reasonably predictable
- types of assessments
  - formative assessment
    - provides feedbacck for remedial work and coaching
    - in/formal tests, tasks, quizzes, discussions or observations
  - summative assessment
    - checks whether the competence has been achieved at hte end of training
    - evaluate skills at/after the end of an instructional unit
  - integrated assessment
    - part of the learning and teaching process
