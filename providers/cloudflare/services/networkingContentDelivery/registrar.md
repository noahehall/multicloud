## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

### pricing

- at cost: you pay what they pay

## basics

- DNSSEC
- Nameservers: the primary DNS controller and identify the location of your domain on the internet.

### Requirements

- All domains using Cloudflare Registrar must use Cloudflare DNS on a full setup.
  - i.e. using Cloudflare for your authoritative DNS nameservers.
- you cannot change to another DNS provider while using Cloudflare Registrar.
