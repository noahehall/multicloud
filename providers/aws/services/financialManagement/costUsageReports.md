## basics

### Cost and Usage Report (CUR)

- download the reports from the S3 console, query the report using Amazon Athena, or upload the report into Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight.

### Billing reports

- separates your usage information and cost by AWS service and function
- types
  - monthly report
  - cost allocation report
  - detailed billing report

### Cost Allocation Tags

- specific to billing and track your AWS costs on a detailed level.
- must be enabled; AWS uses the tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report.
- Cost Allocation Tags appear on the console after you've enabled Cost Explorer, Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Reports, or legacy reports.
- tag types
  - AWS Generated: automatically applied on a best-effort basis; enable in the Billing and Cost Management console.
    - available only in the Billing and Cost Management console and reports, and doesn't appear anywhere else in the AWS console, including the AWS Tag Editor.
  - User Defined: tags that you define, create, and apply to resources.
