## features

- speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects.
- reduces the variability in Internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications
- improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed Edge Locations and over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations

### pricing
