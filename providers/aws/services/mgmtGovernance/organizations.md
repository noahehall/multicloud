# Organizations

- Centrally manage your environment as you scale your AWS resources
- group accounts into logical categories
- use cases
  - manage access, share resources and consolidate billing/audit at the organization level
  - nest organizations to form hierarchies

## my thoughts

- check control towe for a more managed approach if you can afford it
