## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- Simplify your security and access controls across shared resources.
- Streamline management of AWS resources within your organization from a central account.
- Reduce overhead and costs by creating resources once and sharing them across multiple accounts.
- Share foundational infrastructure like Amazon VPC subnets across accounts, allowing multiple accounts to deploy application resources to the same subnet
- Centrally manage resources like private certificate authorities allowing certificate issuance across multiple accounts to manage cost and reduce operational overhead
- Use managed permissions to grant only the permissions required to perform tasks on resources shared using AWS RAM
